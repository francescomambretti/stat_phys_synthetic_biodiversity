`python count_bases.py filename`

Counts the number of A,C,G,T in a list of DNA sequences

-------------------------------------

C++ code for analyzing the sequences:

`./experim_overlaps.x target_file sequences_file_path output_folder_path`

to compile: simply `make` (C++-17 is used, but C++-11 is enough)

The code is described at the beginning of the .cpp file

-------------------------------------

histo.py: does the histogram of the relative species abundance. It has to be internally modified to change the input files

-------------------------------------

compare.py: 2D histogram of maximum and total consecutive overlaps
